### This notebook contains a computer vision project - melanoma classification based on skin lesion images using Tensorflow and TPU.
### Multi-input EfficientNet models were trained with different input image sizes, together with data augmentation and learninng rate scheduling.
### The final prediction was obtained through test time augmentation, and was adjusted by out-of-fold validation AUC.
